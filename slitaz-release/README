slitaz-release - SliTaz stable and cooking release helper
================================================================================
Doc: http://www.slitaz.org/en/devel/release.php


The slitaz-release script is designed to help SliTaz release processes on
all hosts: tank, pangolin, mirror and locally. 


	* Locally it will check release strings in slitaz-base-files, the wok
	  and slitaz-doc repos as well as isolinux.cfg in syslinux package
	
	* On tank it will check for build chroot and ISOs
	
	* On Pangolin it will check for wok-stable and wok latest Hg tags
	
	* On mirror it will check for packages/[version] and uploaded ISOs


Examples:

	# slitaz-release 5.0
	# slitaz-release 6.0 /path/to/local/repos
