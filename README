SliTaz developers and services tools. This package provides the tazdev tool, 
Shell or Python scripts and tinyutils to help maintain the distribution and
automate the packages compilation. The package provides 'tazdev' and its 
default config file which goes in: /etc/slitaz/tazdev.conf

The scripts folder provides small scripts for special tasks and some code
used by some of the contributors. Feel free to put your own scripts in here, 
but add some comments to let people quickly know what they do.
