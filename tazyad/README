Yad on SliTaz
================================================================================


Yad is the new prefered way to create GUI boxes for SliTaz desktop. We use
Yad GTK boxes for all user and administrator interfaces that can't be handled
by TazPanel (admin panel) or TazDE (desktop environment). Both are powered
by CGI scripts and use xHTML 5 and CSS 3 for the UI. Yad is a powerfull tool
witch support latest GTK actions and goodies. With our original GTKdialog
scripts some nice features was missing like for example --notification or
ENTER for event (with gtkdialog one must press a button).

If you motivated to code, please have a look at the TODO file and continue
reading :-)


Coding guidlines
----------------
Use a function and a function_main for main= variable to keep datas,
that way we can have yad boxes commands separated from shell script.
Here is a structure example:

# function_main
# function_other
# function

Use gettext to have a translated application and forget echo. Use 'case'
as most as possible, it is the faster way to handle or parse commands
and options. Use fgrep when possible.

To start you will find a template script called tazyad, copy it and start
coding from that :-). Tazyad is commented to help you getting started.
You can also have a look to tazpkg-notify who was the first official Yad
script for SliTaz.


Missing stuff
-------------
I'm member og Yad Google group and will mail them about SliTaz using Yad
and these missing features. Yad is a small projetc but the maintainer seems
a very nice guy who listen th his users :-)

	* It would be nice to have an --exit or --kill option for notification
	* Not way to have a custom icon for custom button
