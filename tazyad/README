Yad on SliTaz
================================================================================


Yad is the new prefered way to create GUI boxes for the SliTaz desktop. We use
Yad GTK boxes for all user and administrator interfaces that can't be handled
by TazPanel (admin panel) or TazDE (desktop environment). Both are powered
by CGI scripts and use xHTML 5 and CSS 3 for the UI. Yad is a powerful tool
which supports the latest GTK actions and goodies. With our original GTKdialog
scripts some nice features were missing like for example --notification or
ENTER for event (with gtkdialog one must press a button).

If you're motivated to code, please have a look at the TODO file and continue
reading :-)


Coding guidlines
----------------
Use a function and a function_main for main= variable to keep data,
that way we can have yad boxes commands separated from shell scripts.
Here is a structure example:

# function_main
# function_other
# function

Use gettext to have a translated application and forget echo. Use 'case'
as much as possible, it is the faster way to handle or parse commands
and options. Use fgrep when possible.

To start you will find a template script called tazyad, copy it and start
coding from that :-). Tazyad is commented to help you get started.
You can also have a look to tazpkg-notify which was the first official Yad
script for SliTaz.


Missing stuff
-------------
I'm a member of Yad Google group and will mail them about SliTaz using Yad
and these missing features. Yad is a small project but the maintainer seems
a very nice guy who listens to his users :-)

	* It would be nice to have an --exit or --kill option for notification
	* No way to have a custom icon for custom button
