<p>This floppy set uses the BIOS instead of the linux driver. You can boot
SliTaz using unsupported floppy drives such as some PCMCIA devices.</p>

<p>The web version of 1.0 is launched by default: the filesystem is mounted
from the web. You can select memtest or ipxe with the up, down and enter keys
(the boot menu is built with
<a href="http://hg.slitaz.org/wok-tiny/file/c82d2b7a51b4/linux/stuff/bundle">this tool</a>).</p>

<p>Start your computer with <tt>fd001.img</tt>. It will show the kernel version
string and the kernel cmdline line. You can edit the cmdline. Most users can
just press Enter.</p>

<p>The floppy is then loaded into memory (one dot each 64KB) and you will be
prompted to insert the next floppy, <tt>fd002.img</tt>.</p>
