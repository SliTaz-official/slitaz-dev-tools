<p>You can start with one of the 4 following flavors:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>base</b> needs 38MB of RAM and 6 floppies: <tt>fd001.img</tt> to
		<tt>fd006.img</tt>.<br>
		base provides the minimum SliTaz distribution subset in text mode.</li>
	<li><b>justx</b> needs 64MB of RAM and 13 floppies: <tt>fd001.img</tt> to
		<tt>fd106.img</tt>.<br>
		justx provides the minimum SliTaz distribution subset with X11
		support.</li>
	<li><b>gtkonly</b> needs 96MB of RAM and 18 floppies: <tt>fd001.img</tt> to
		<tt>fd204.img</tt>.<br>
		gtkonly provides the minimum SliTaz distribution subset with GTK+
		support.</li>
	<li><b>core</b> needs 128MB of RAM and 28 floppies: <tt>fd001.img</tt> to
		<tt>fd309.img</tt>.<br>
		core provides the default SliTaz distribution.</li>
</ul>

<p>Start your computer with <tt>fd001.img</tt>. It will show the kernel version
string and the kernel cmdline line. You can edit the cmdline. Most users can
just press Enter.</p>

<p>The floppy is then loaded into memory (one dot each 64KB) and you will be
prompted to insert the next floppy, <tt>fd002.img</tt>. And so on up to last
floppy.</p>

<p>You will be prompted to insert extra floppies for justx, gtkonly and core
flavors. You can bypass this by using B to boot without loading extra
floppies.</p>
