You can start with one of the 3 following flavors :
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <b>base</b> needs 32Mb of RAM and 5 floppies: <i>fd001.img</i> to <i>fd005.img</i>.<br />
  base provides the minimum slitaz distribution subset in text mode. 
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>justx</b> needs 96M of RAM and 11 floppies: <i>fd001.img</i> to <i>fd105.img</i>.<br />
  justx provides the minimum slitaz distribution subset with X11 support. 
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>core</b> needs 160M of RAM and 22 floppies: <i>fd001.img</i> to <i>fd210.img</i>.<br />
  core provides the default slitaz distribution. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Start your computer with <i>fd001.img</i>. It will show the kernel version string and
the kernel cmdline line. You can edit the cmdline. Most users can just press Enter.
</p>
<p>
The floppy is then loaded into memory (one dot each 64k) and you will be prompted to
insert the next floppy, <i>fd002.img</i>. And so on up to <i>fd005.img</i>.
</p>
<p>
The base flavor will then start and you will be prompted to insert extra floppies
for justx and core flavors. You can bypass this by using Q and Enter.
