<p>This floppy set uses the BIOS instead of the linux driver. You can boot
SliTaz using unsupported floppy drives such as some PCMCIA devices.</p>

<p>The web version of 3.0 is launched by default - the filesystem is mostly mounted
from the web.</p>

<p>Start your computer with <tt>fd001.img</tt>. It will show the kernel version
string and the kernel cmdline line. You can edit the cmdline. Most users can
just press Enter.</p>

<p>The floppy is then loaded into memory (one dot each 64KB) and you will be
prompted to insert the next floppy, <tt>fd002.img</tt>. And so on up to
<tt>fd005.img</tt>.</p>
