<p>You can start with one of the 2 following flavors:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>base</b> needs 20MB of RAM and 5 floppies: <tt>fd001.img</tt> to
		<tt>fd005.img</tt>.<br>
		base provides the minimum SliTaz distribution subset in text mode.</li>
	<li><b>core</b> needs 80MB of RAM and 24 floppies: <tt>fd001.img</tt> to
		<tt>fd118.img</tt>.<br>
		core provides the default SliTaz distribution.</li>
</ul>

<p>Start your computer with <tt>fd001.img</tt>. It will show the kernel version
string and the kernel cmdline line. You can edit the cmdline. Most users can
just press Enter.</p>

<p>The floppy is then loaded into memory (one dot each 64KB) and you will be
prompted to insert the next floppy, <tt>fd002.img</tt>.</p>

<p>The loram bootstrap will then start and you will be prompted to insert extra
floppies for the core flavor. You can bypass this by using Q and Enter.</p>

<p>If you have an ext3 partition on your hard disk, the bootstrap can create the
installation script <code>slitaz/install.sh</code>. You will be able to install
SliTaz on your hard disk without extra media.</p>
