TazTPD - SliTaz micro HTTP Web Server
================================================================================


TazTPD is a very small Web Server all in Shell script who can be run in user
space and so without root access. TazTPD is not designed to be used in a 
production envirinment but for fun, for testing, to easily and on demand serve
static files or dynamic content with CGI scripts.

The goal is to keep TazTPD core as small and response as possible. Everything
is possible, we may have better directory listing and several plugins depending
on users feedbacks, requests and our free time.

TazTPD is also a nice base to create small or custom servers dedicated to
a special task such as streaming audio and with a very small footprint. By
the way, TazTPD output some valid xHTML 5 documents with a clean generated
code.

Under the hood... This small (actuall 3Kb) Web Server will be part of all
SliTaz installation and dedicated to the the user! Yes it can do many
things with it CGI capacity and the so famous QUERY_STRING without talking
about it is all SHell, Ash compatible, like all other SliTaz tools and utility.
So the idea is here now the code must follow, but we will have a full Tazpkg
web based graphical interface.


Quick notes
-----------

	* CGI scripts must be executable: chmod 0777 *.cgi
	* xHTML and text CGI scripts works well
	* TazTPD can run in user mode throught nc and from inetd
	  --> www stream tcp nowait nobody /usr/bin/taztpd taztpd
