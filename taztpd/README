TazTPD - SliTaz micro HTTP Web Server
================================================================================


TazTPD is a very small Web Server written in Shell script which can be run in 
user space and so without root access. TazTPD is not designed to be used in a 
production environment but for fun, for testing, to easily serve static files or 
dynamic content on demand with CGI scripts.

The goal is to keep the TazTPD core as small and responsive as possible. Anything
is possible, we may have better directory listings and several plugins depending
on user feedback, requests and our free time.

TazTPD is also a nice base to create small or custom servers dedicated to
special tasks such as streaming audio with a very small footprint. By
the way, TazTPD outputs valid xHTML 5 documents with clean generated
code.

Under the hood... This small (actual 3Kb) Web Server will be part of all
SliTaz installations and dedicated to the the user! Yes it can do many
things with its CGI capacity like the famous QUERY_STRING. Without talking
about it, it's all SHell, Ash compatible, like all other SliTaz tools and 
utilities. So the idea is here, now the code must follow, but we will have a 
full Tazpkg web based graphical interface.


Quick notes
-----------

	* CGI scripts must be executable: chmod 0777 *.cgi
	* xHTML and text CGI scripts works well
	* TazTPD can run in user mode through nc and from inetd
	  --> www stream tcp nowait nobody /usr/bin/taztpd taztpd
